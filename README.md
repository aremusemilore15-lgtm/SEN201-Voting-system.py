1. Planning / Requirement Analysis
•	Problem Identified: Manual voting is slow and error-prone.
•	Requirements:
o	The system must allow voters to select a candidate.
o	Count votes automatically.
o	Display the total votes and the winner.
o	Prevent invalid inputs.
•	Objective: To create a simple voting system using Python that is easy to use and accurate.

2. System Design
•	Input: Candidate number selected by voter
•	Process:
o	Display candidates
o	Accept and validate input
o	Count votes
•	Output:
o	Total votes per candidate
o	Winner of the election

3. Implementation (Coding)
•	Python Code: (Paste your voting system Python code here)
•	Explanation: Comment each part of your code in your own words

4. Testing
•	Test Cases:
1.	Input valid candidate numbers → vote counts should increase correctly
2.	Input invalid numbers → system should display “Invalid vote”
3.	Multiple voters → system should allow repeated voting until stopped
•	Expected Result:
o	Correct counting of votes
o	Accurate winner displayed
o	No crashes on invalid input

5. Deployment / Maintenance
•	Deployment: System runs on Python IDE (IDLE, VS Code, PyCharm)
•	Maintenance:
o	Adding more candidates
o	Changing voting rules
o	Improving interface (optional GUI in future)

6. Conclusion
•	The SDLC approach ensured the project is well-structured
•	The Simple Voting System meets the objectives: easy to use, counts votes correctly, and displays results
